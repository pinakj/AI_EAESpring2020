# GameAI
 
Assignment 1.

All the behaviours were implemented as static methods in the file MovementAlgorithms.h/cpp in the folder \of_v0.11.0_vs2017_release\apps\myApps\GameAIAssignments in the repo.

Its seemed like the openframeworks project generator requires the solution to be in the myApps folder..

When the solution runs it will first display the basic motion behavior.

You can press the left arrow key to restart the current simulation.

You can press the right arrow key to move to the next simulation.

The current simulation title is displayed in the window bar.

The write up can be found inside the write up folder and the screenshots are both in the pdf itself and in the screenshots folder.

Note: if for some reason there is an error while running that says it cant find the openframeworks files. If you download them from the openframeworks website (https://openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.11.0/of_v0.11.0_vs2017_release.zip) and drop them into the repo and add any missing file to of_v0.11.0_vs2017_release it should work.
Not sure why this is happening since I added all the files to the repo anyway.
